# Predicting Mobile App User Purchases
*Team Members: Evan Calkins, Ran Huang, Alan Perry*

## Project Description
For USF's Advanced Machine Learning class final project, an industry partner provided us with a real world dataset of anonymized user app activity. Data was provided for users created within a 2.5 month period, with the goal being to predict whether or not those users would make a purchase within the next 7 or 14 days. User data was distributed across three datasets: events, sessions, and attributes. Our team focused on computing user-specific features taking into account recency, frequency, and magnitude of activity, as well as training various tree-based and stacking models known to perform well on tabular data.

As part of the project, our class competed in a private Kaggle competition. Our team won the competition with a private leaderboard score of 0.971. As a result, we were given the opportunity to present our project at the USF Data Institute's Weekly Seminar.
